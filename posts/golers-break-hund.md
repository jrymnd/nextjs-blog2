The percentage of golfers who break 100 can vary depending on the source and the specific demographic of golfers being surveyed. However, according to a report by the National Golf Foundation (NGF), approximately 26% of golfers in the United States have a handicap of 18.0 or better, which equates to a scoring average of roughly 90 or lower for 18 holes. This means that the remaining 74% of golfers, on average, shoot over 90 for 18 holes.

It's important to note that not all golfers have an official handicap, and therefore, the percentage of golfers who break 100 may differ from those who have a handicap. However, another study by the NGF found that approximately 60% of golfers in the U.S. shoot 100 or higher on a typical 18-hole course.

Overall, the data suggests that a significant majority of golfers do not break 100 on a regular basis, with estimates ranging from around 60% to 74%. However, it's worth noting that these figures are based on surveys and may not accurately reflect the skill level of all golfers.
